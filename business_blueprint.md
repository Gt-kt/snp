# 🚀 The 10,000 USD "Iron-Mochi" Business Blueprint
**Target Audience:** You (Korean Citizen, Tired of Corporate Life, $10k Capital, Coding Skills)
**Model:** "Insight-as-a-Service" (Micro-SaaS / Paid Newsletter)

## 1. The Core Concept
You said you have "no skills," but you are building a sophisticated Python trading bot (`Titan Trade`). **This IS your skill.**
Most people in Korea want to invest but have zero time or ability to analyze 500+ stocks.
**The Idea:** Do not just trade with your $10k. **Sell the shovels.** Use your code to generate a "Daily Alpha Report" and sell it.

## 2. Why This Works in Korea (2026)
*   **High Demand:** "Salaryman Tech" (Jaetech) is a national obsession.
*   **Low Trust:** Most "Leading Rooms" (Ribang) are scams. A *data-backed, transparent* quantitative report stands out.
*   **Zero Inventory:** Your product is a PDF/Email generated by Python. Cost of Goods Sold = $0.

## 3. The Execution Plan (Budget: < $500)

### Phase 1: The Engine (Current Step)
*   **Goal:** Make `titan_trade.py` effortless. (We just improved it).
*   **Action:** Ensure it runs every morning at 8:00 AM automatically.
*   **Output:** A clean list of 3-5 "High Probability" setups (VCP Breakouts, Dip Buys).

### Phase 2: The Wrapper (Productization)
*   **Do not sell the code.** Sell the *insight*.
*   **Create a PDF Report:** Use a library like `fpdf` or `reportlab` to auto-convert your text output into a clean, professional PDF:
    *   "Titan Daily Briefing"
    *   Section 1: Market Regime (Bull/Bear Traffic Light)
    *   Section 2: Top 3 Picks (with the "Why" - e.g., "Win Rate 65% in backtest")
    *   Section 3: Risk Warning (This builds trust).

### Phase 3: Distribution (The "Blue Ocean")
*   **Naver Blog / Tistory:** Post *yesterday's* successful picks for free. "Look what Titan found yesterday." (Proof of Work).
*   **KakaoTalk Open Chat:** Create a free room. Post the "Market Status" summary every morning. Upsell the full PDF for a coffee price.
*   **Pricing:**
    *   **Tier 1:** Free (Market Status + 1 Stock Teaser)
    *   **Tier 2:** 9,900 KRW / month (Full Daily PDF) -> **Goal:** 1,000 subscribers = ~10 Million KRW/month.
    *   **Tier 3:** 50,000 USD (Once you have capital) -> Your own trading.

## 4. Why Capital ($10k) is Safe
*   You don't spend the $10k on rent or inventory.
*   You keep the $10k for **Trading** your own system (Tier 3).
*   Your business expense is only:
    *   Hosting (AWS Free Tier or cheap VPS): $5/mo
    *   Data API (yfinance is free, maybe upgrade later): $0 - $30/mo
    *   Marketing: Time (Naver SEO).

## 5. Next Steps
1.  **Trust the Code:** We just updated `titan_trade.py` to check for earnings and filter strictly. It is now a professional tool.
2.  **Start Small:** Don't quit your job yet. Run this for 1 month "on the side."
3.  **First Sale:** Try to sell the subscription to ONE person (even a friend). If you sell one, you can sell a thousand.

> **"If you were me, what would you do?"**
> I would not open a chicken shop or a cafe. I would build a digital army of bots (Titan Trade) that work for me while I sleep, and sell their intelligence to the millions of tired office workers who dream of financial freedom just like you.
